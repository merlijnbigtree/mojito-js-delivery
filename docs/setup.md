# Experiment setup

There are two approaches to setup experiments in Mojito. The **gulp** builder supports both methods when building the JS container.

1. **[Straight JS](#straight-js-setup)**: define experiment parameters, trigger code and variant code in a single JS file: `test-object.js`

2. **[YAML](#yaml-setup)**: define experiment parameters in a YAML file: `config.yml`. All JS and CSS are separated into individual files.

We recommend the **YAML** approach for a few reasons:

- Easier to read and setup - YAML abtracts away JS syntax around experiment configuration parameters.

- Easier to develop experiments - chunking down JS & CSS is good practice; great for debugging and results in less code sphagetti.

- Extra variant code minification - the YAML build path further minifies variant code like CSS to further reduce the weight of your container.

- Great for code re-use and portability - e.g. send your developers winning variant code for permanent implementation which is easy to unpack and integrate.

However, for the purposes of this guide, it's beneficial to first demonstrate a **straight JS** setup, as it better reflects how Mojito works under the hood.

## Straight JS setup

Let's create a simple experiment with the following parameters:

Parameter | &nbsp;
--- | ---
Trigger | Activate when users enter your site from google
Control variant | No change
Treatment variant | Alert the user with a simple message

Start by creating a file in your repo: 

`repo/lib/waves/ex1/test-object.js`

Define experiment parameters in an object that's passed into `Mojito.addTest()`, like so:

```js
Mojito.addTest({
    id: 'ex1',
    name:'Google message straight JS',
    sampleRate: 1,
    state: 'live',
    trigger:function(test){
        // Only activate and bucket users into the experiment if they come from Google
        if (document.referrer.indexOf('google.com') > -1) test.activate();
    },
    recipes:{
        '0': {
            name: 'Control'
        },
        '1':{
            name: 'Treatment',
            js: function() {
                // As soon as the user is bucketed into the experiment, this code will run
                alert('Hi Google user!');
            }
        }
    }
});
```

That's all there is to this experiment. Many of the parameter keys and values are self explanatory, and we'll explore them in [more detail](#experiment-parameters) after looking at the **YAML** approach.

## YAML setup

To setup the same experiment, start by creating:

`repo/lib/waves/ex2/config.yml`

Define experiment parameters in YAML:

```yml
id: ex2
name: Google message YAML
sampleRate: 1
state: live
trigger: trigger.js
recipes:
  0:
    name: Control
  1:
    name: Treatment
    js: treatment.js
```

*Look familiar?*

Each key here maps directly to a key in the object we saw in the straight JS setup. Values are also mapped identically, except any JS/CSS are declared as file names that point to files which you'll create in the same directory as `config.yml`.

`repo/lib/waves/ex2/trigger.js` contains trigger/activation code:

```js
function trigger(test){
    // Only activate and bucket users into the experiment if they come from Google
    if (document.referrer.indexOf('google.com') > -1) test.activate();
}
```

`repo/lib/waves/ex2/treatment.js` contains variant code:

```js
function treatment(){
    // As soon as the user is bucketed into the experiment, this code will run
    alert('Hi Google user!');
}
```

Your experiment directory should look like:

```
ex2/
  |-- config.yml
  |-- treatment.js
  |-- trigger.js
```

With these files defined, the gulp builder will construct an experiment object resembling what we saw in the straight JS setup and stitch it into the container along with `mojito.js`.

## Experiment shared code

JS and CSS can have a shared scope within an experiment. E.g. two treatment variants might have some styling commonalities. We can cut down on repeated code by sharing common elements.

### Experiment shared JS

Setup instructions:

1. Create a JS file containing shared code in an experiment's directory
2. In `config.yml`, point the root level `js` key to the file
3. Any variant can now reference code within the shared JS by passing in the experiment/test object into the variant JS

#### Example

`repo/lib/waves/mytest/shared.js`:

```js
{
    sharedFn: function() {
        //do something
    }
}
```

`repo/lib/waves/mytest/config.yml`:

```yml
js: shared.js
id: mytest
name: My example test
sampleRate: 1
state: staging
trigger: trigger.js
recipes:
  0:
    name: Control
  1:
    name: Treatment1
    js: treatment1.js
  2:
    name: Treatment2
    js: treatment2.js
```

`repo/lib/waves/mytest/treatment1.js`:

```js
// pass in the 'test' object into the treatment function
function treatment1(test) {
    // call shared functions using dot notation
    test.options.js.sharedFn();
    // ... other transformations
}
```

`repo/lib/waves/mytest/treatment2.js`:

```js
// pass in the 'test' object into the treatment function
function treatment2(test) {
    // call shared functions using dot notation
    test.options.js.sharedFn();
    // ... other transformations
}
```

### Experiment shared CSS

Setup instructions:

1. Create a CSS file containing shared CSS in an experiment's directory
2. In `config.yml`, point the root level `css` key to the file

Shared CSS is injected into the document when the test is activated, regardless of the variant (including "Control").

#### Example

`repo/lib/waves/mytest/shared.css`:

```css
.myClass {
    color: blue;
    padding: 10px 10px;
}
```

`repo/lib/waves/mytest/config.yml`:

```yml
css: shared.css
id: mytest
name: My example test
sampleRate: 1
state: staging
trigger: trigger.js
recipes:
  0:
    name: Control
  1:
    name: Treatment1
    js: treatment1.js
  2:
    name: Treatment2
    js: treatment2.js
```

## Experiment parameters

Important experiment parameters to understand are:

Parameter key | Values | Description
--- | --- | ---
`state` | `live` or `staging` or `inactive` | Controls the status of the experiment. `staging` means the experiment is disabled from normal visitors but able to be [previewed](preview-launch.md). `inactive` means the experiment will be ignored during build but remain in your repo for reference.
`sampleRate` | Float between `0` and `1` | Controls portion of overall traffic to be allocated to the experiment. `0` = 0%, `1` = 100%.
`id` | A string | Identifier used for analytics/reporting and forcing variants in preview mode.
`recipe` | A nested list | Defines experiment variants and their parameters. <br> `{recipeId}`: *A string: variant indentifier*<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`name: {recipeName}` *A string: descriptive variant name*<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`js: {recipe.js}` *Variant JS filename(optional)*<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`css: {recipe.css}` *Variant CSS filename (optional)*<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`sampleRate: {float between 0 and 1}` *Controls portion of experiment traffic to allocate to variant (optional)*
`trigger` | `{trigger.js}` | Experiment trigger JS filename.
`divertTo` | `{recipeId}` | Allows diverting 100% of traffic to a specific variant. Handy when you have found a winner and want to temporarily divert traffic to it.

Full details and explanations of other parameters can be found in [config-template.yml](../config-template.yml).

## Next steps

Now that you've setup an experiment or two, you'll want to customise your Mojito container.

Next, [configure your container settings & tracking](customisation.md).
